Karl's Gentoo Toys is a collection of my past shell scripts, play and other research ideas using and building Gentoo linux.

This as a picture of where I have been, many of these files are old, some have been moved around. 

nothing here is guarintied to work!!!  

this repository is aimed at experenced developers to view my coding style and get a picture of my experience with Linux Shell scripting

I have secussfully built and installed Gentoo on x86, PPC (iBook G3, PowerMac G4), Sparc 64 (SUN Ultra 10 Creator 3D).

I have also performed a shoehorned Instal of Gentoo Linux on an AppleTV 1, Dec Alpha EV56.
